# Facebook Group Member Scraper

This is a powerful and resilient browser script designed to scrape member data from Facebook groups. Its primary feature is its robustness: **progress is never lost**, even if your browser crashes or you close the tab. It is designed specifically to handle very large groups (10k, 30k, 50k+ members) by using intelligent scrolling and a persistent database built into your browser.

## Features

*   **✅ Resilient Data Storage:** Uses IndexedDB to save data instantly. If the scrape is interrupted, you can resume exactly where you left off without losing a single profile.
*   **🚀 Automated Continuous Scrolling:** Simulates a user continuously scrolling to the bottom of the page, rapidly loading all members without manual effort.
*   **🧠 Intelligent Operation:** The script automatically detects when it has reached the end of the member list and stops itself. It also auto-pauses and resumes if new data is slow to load.
*   **💾 Automatic Backups:** For very long scraping sessions, the script will automatically download a CSV backup of your progress every few minutes.
*   **📊 Simple UI:** A clean, draggable on-screen control panel allows you to start, stop, and export your data with ease.
*   **📄 CSV Export:** Download all collected data (Profile ID, Full Name, Profile Link, Bio, etc.) into a clean CSV file at any time.

## How It Works

This script is **not** a traditional screen scraper that reads the HTML of the page. Instead, it works by intercepting the background network requests the Facebook page makes to its servers to fetch member data.

1.  The script listens for API calls to `/api/graphql/`.
2.  When new member data is loaded, the script captures the clean JSON response.
3.  It parses this data and saves the profiles directly into the browser's IndexedDB database.

This method is highly efficient and more reliable than DOM scraping, as it's less likely to break when Facebook updates its visual layout.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the **Members** or **People** page of the Facebook group you want to scrape.
2.  Open your browser's Developer Tools (press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I**).
3.  Click on the **Console** tab.
4.  Copy the entire `scraper.js` script.
5.  Paste the script into the console and press **Enter**.
6.  The control panel will appear on the bottom-right of the page. Use it to manage the scrape.

## The Control Panel

 <!-- You can replace this with a screenshot of your UI -->

*   **📊 `[Count]`**: Shows the current number of unique profiles saved in the database.
*   **▶ START / ⏸ STOP**: Toggles the automatic scrolling. Click START to begin scraping and STOP to pause.
*   **💾 CSV**: Instantly downloads a CSV file of all the profiles you have collected so far.
*   **👁 Data**: Prints instructions to the console on how to view the raw IndexedDB data in your browser's developer tools.
*   **🗑 Reset**: Deletes **all** stored data for this scraper. A confirmation prompt will appear to prevent accidental deletion.

## Important: Handling Large Groups & Memory Limits

When scraping very large groups (e.g., >15,000 members), you may encounter a browser warning: **"Paused before potential out-of-memory crash."**

**This is normal and your data is safe.**

#### The Problem: Browser RAM, Not the Script

*   This message comes from your **browser**, not the script.
*   As the script scrolls, Facebook loads thousands of profiles onto the page. Keeping all these profiles rendered consumes a huge amount of your computer's RAM.
*   To prevent a single web page from crashing your entire computer, browsers enforce a **per-tab memory limit** (often 2-4GB). When the page hits this limit, the browser pauses everything.
*   Our script itself is very memory-efficient; it saves data to disk (IndexedDB) and doesn't hold it in memory. The issue is purely the visual rendering of the page.

#### The Hardware Nuance

The limit you hit depends on your hardware. A computer with 16GB of RAM might hit the limit around 15,000 loaded profiles. A more powerful machine with 64GB of RAM may be able to load 30,000 profiles or more before needing intervention.

### The Solution: The "Refresh & Resume" Strategy

Because your data is always saved, you can easily bypass this memory limit.

1.  **Refresh the Page:** When the browser pauses or crashes, simply refresh the Facebook group members page. This will clear the browser's memory.
2.  **Re-run the Script:** Paste the scraper script into the console again and press Enter.
3.  **Progress is Restored:** The control panel will appear and the counter will immediately show your previous total (e.g., `14570`), as it's reading from the saved database.
4.  **Click ▶ START:** The script will begin scrolling from the top again.
5.  **Be Patient During "Catch-Up":** For the first few minutes, the script will be scrolling through members it has already saved. **You will see the page scrolling, but the counter will not increase.** This is expected behavior. The script is ignoring duplicates until it scrolls down to where it left off.
6.  **Resuming the Scrape:** Once it scrolls past all the saved members, it will find new ones, and the counter will begin ticking up again.

By using this simple refresh-and-resume technique, you can scrape groups of virtually any size.
